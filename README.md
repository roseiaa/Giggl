# Giggl
Giggl is a real-time chat app, similar to WhatsApp, that allows users to send messages/images to each other. It allows users to filter by online users, change the theme of the application, and has built-in authentication for security. This project was developed using JavaScript, with React for the frontend, MongoDB for the backend, and Socket.io for the real-time features. The application also uses a mix of TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for styling, with the optional theme toggle to switch between light/dark mode.
